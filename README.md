Previously on "Pretty Little Liars".

2
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:04,912
This dress is the black swan.

3
00:00:04,946 --> 00:00:06,180
She's leaving.
Hurry!

4
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:08,015
If the black swan
wasn't guilty of something,

5
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,149
why would she run
from you guys?

6
00:00:09,184 --> 00:00:10,751
I thought that we had a deal

7
00:00:10,785 --> 00:00:11,819
about you not coming out here.

8
00:00:11,853 --> 00:00:12,886
What was I supposed
to tell you?

9
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:13,887
The truth?

10
00:00:13,922 --> 00:00:15,055
Somebody took you there

11
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,091
to make it look like
you dug up Ali's body.

12
00:00:18,126 --> 00:00:20,027
"Game on, bitches."

13
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,929
"A."

14
00:00:21,963 --> 00:00:22,963
Wow, Jenna.

15
00:00:22,997 --> 00:00:24,932
All this time you could see.

16
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:26,800
It was the only
protection I had.

17
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:29,036
I'm sorry. Maybe I'll hear that
from your father tomorrow too.

18
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,904
You're seeing him?
We have lunch plans.

19
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:32,239
I guess I have you
to thank for that.

20
00:00:32,273 --> 00:00:33,774
Spencer, did you
call the hospital?

21
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:34,775
Are they sending the records?

22
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:35,476
There aren't any records.

23
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,810
What's that supposed to mean?

24
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:38,912
It means Melissa didn't
lose her baby in June.

25
00:00:38,947 --> 00:00:40,948
You're big on games,
but get this straight:

26
00:00:40,982 --> 00:00:42,182
Do not not mess with Hanna.

27
00:00:44,853 --> 00:00:46,954
I've decided to defend
Garrett Reynolds.

28
00:00:46,988 --> 00:00:48,856
This is the man who
killed my best friend.

29
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,891
He killed the girl Emily
was in love with.

30
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:53,127
Accused of killing him.

31
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,234
Do we really believe that Jenna
was off on a joyride that night?

32
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,970
It was her plan to take Emily
to Ali's grave all along.

33
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:04,938
Seemed to me like she
was scared of someone.

34
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:07,207
And it seemed like she
was blind for five months

35
00:01:07,242 --> 00:01:08,809
when she wasn't.

36
00:01:08,843 --> 00:01:10,210
For purposes of my head
not exploding,

37
00:01:10,245 --> 00:01:11,912
could we just say that she
is telling the truth?

38
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:12,980
Well, that would
mean that we would

39
00:01:13,014 --> 00:01:15,749
cross her off the new "A" list.

40
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:16,950
Then who's still on it?

41
00:01:16,985 --> 00:01:17,951
Lucas?

42
00:01:17,986 --> 00:01:19,019
No way.

43
00:01:19,053 --> 00:01:20,187
He might be
a little unhinged lately,

44
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:22,222
but he's not capable
of digging up a grave.

45
00:01:22,257 --> 00:01:25,025
Guys, all roads lead back
to the black swan.

46
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:27,060
We know that she was
working with Mona,

47
00:01:27,095 --> 00:01:29,163
the sketches were in her lair.

48
00:01:29,197 --> 00:01:31,965
Spencer, mom wants to know
if you want anything else.

49
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,101
Uh, no. Thank you, mom.

50
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,803
Melissa looks great.

51
00:01:36,838 --> 00:01:39,106
Yeah, she's back to
being size too skinny.

52
00:01:40,775 --> 00:01:43,944
Black swan skinny?
Think about it.

53
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,113
We know that she lied about
when she lost her baby.

54
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,214
Whoa, back up.

55
00:01:47,248 --> 00:01:48,882
You think that she
was pretending

56
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:50,017
to be pregnant for that long?

57
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:51,051
No. That's, like, months.

58
00:01:51,085 --> 00:01:52,119
There's no way.

59
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,954
She wouldn't do that
to my parents.

60
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,088
Who else could it be?

61
00:01:55,123 --> 00:01:56,790
Mona started talking again,

62
00:01:56,824 --> 00:01:58,959
so maybe she can give
me some answers.

63
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:03,897
Did you really think you
could avoid me forever?

64
00:02:03,932 --> 00:02:05,766
How could you defend Garrett?

65
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,702
Let's not have this
conversation here.

66
00:02:08,736 --> 00:02:10,137
Oh, it doesn't bother you that
he murdered my sister?

67
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,906
Look, I understand you're upset,
but this isn't the place.

68
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:14,107
Just tell me why
you're doing it.

69
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:19,146
Everyone deserves
a competent legal defense.

70
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,914
You sure that's
the only reason?

71
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,986
Let the process
play out, Jason.

72
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,088
Focus on taking care
of your family

73
00:02:28,122 --> 00:02:29,189
and yourself.

74
00:02:29,224 --> 00:02:33,060
Don't worry. I am.

75
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:41,134
Jason? Are you okay?

76
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:44,204
No. But I will be.

77
00:02:56,985 --> 00:03:00,787
"Imagine what I could do
with 50 grand. - A."

78
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,862
<i>♪ Got a secret,</i>
<i>can you keep it ♪</i>

79
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:11,131

85
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:43,797
Mom.

86
00:03:43,831 --> 00:03:46,667
Have you seen this?

87
00:03:46,701 --> 00:03:48,068
It's hard not to.

88
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,003
He's plastered them
all over town.

89
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:51,872
Do you think that he's
gonna get any calls?

90
00:03:51,906 --> 00:03:55,942
Tons. Mostly from people trying
to scam him out of his money.

91
00:03:55,977 --> 00:03:59,079
Well, if he finds the
person that dug up the body,

92
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,747
what's gonna happen to them?

93
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:01,948
Stealing a body's a felony,

94
00:04:01,983 --> 00:04:04,951
so they'd go to jail
for at least ten years.

95
00:04:04,986 --> 00:04:07,721
And they'd probably get a life
sentence for killing Allison.

96
00:04:07,755 --> 00:04:10,924
Wait. So now you're
convinced Garrett's innocent?

97
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,859
No, I'm saying it'll be
easy to build a case

98
00:04:12,894 --> 00:04:14,761
against a person
who took the body.

99
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,734
Not only did my dad
get a new haircut,

100
00:04:20,768 --> 00:04:22,869
but he's also wearing
a new aftershave.

101
00:04:22,904 --> 00:04:25,639
Soun like he's
got a date to me.

102
00:04:25,673 --> 00:04:27,808
He smells like baby wipes.

103
00:04:27,842 --> 00:04:28,875
Does your mom know?

104
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,077
No.

105
00:04:30,111 --> 00:04:31,945
It's one thing to say
he's going out on a date,

106
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,047
it's another to say
that it's with Meredith.

107
00:04:34,082 --> 00:04:35,749
Hey, you.

108
00:04:35,783 --> 00:04:37,918
It's better she hears it
from you than someone else.

109
00:04:47,929 --> 00:04:48,995
Hey.

110
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,898
Hey. Are you on
your way home?

111
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:53,834
Yeah. I thought we
could do dinner.

112
00:04:53,868 --> 00:04:55,702
Oh, well.
You're looking at it.

113
00:04:55,737 --> 00:04:57,104
I have a pile of essays
to get through.

114
00:04:57,138 --> 00:04:59,639
Oh. Okay.

115
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,774
Tomorrow night?

116
00:05:00,808 --> 00:05:01,975
Well, don't tell anybody,

117
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:05,712
but I will have some
pop quizzes to grade.

118
00:05:05,747 --> 00:05:07,781
But I'm home all weekend, so,

119
00:05:07,815 --> 00:05:09,583
rain check for Sunday?

120
00:05:09,617 --> 00:05:11,885
Yeah, sure.

121
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,855
Didn't you stay in
last weekend though?

122
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:17,824
Don't you just wanna go out,
be around people?

123
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:21,995
I am around people.
All day, Monday through Friday.

124
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:23,964
Yeah, teenagers.

125
00:05:23,998 --> 00:05:26,933
You should call up some friends.
Go have a girls night out.

126
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:29,770
And who would that be?
All my friends have husbands.

127
00:05:29,804 --> 00:05:33,073
Besides, I'd much rather spend
a quiet night alone with you.

128
00:05:34,842 --> 00:05:36,676
Unless you have plans.

129
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,679
That's not it.
I just...

130
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,981
what?

131
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:43,784
Nothing.

132
00:05:43,818 --> 00:05:45,919
I'll see you Sunday.
Love you.

133
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:47,888
Love you.

134
00:05:55,763 --> 00:05:57,898
Mona vanderwall isn't
allowed visitors.

135
00:05:57,932 --> 00:05:59,766
Since when?

136
00:05:59,801 --> 00:06:00,967
Since the doctor ordered it.

137
00:06:01,002 --> 00:06:03,770
Well, I've been visiting her
for the past few weeks,

138
00:06:03,805 --> 00:06:04,905
so there must be a mistake.

139
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:06,640
No mistake.

140
00:06:06,674 --> 00:06:08,742
I'll just be a few minutes,
I promise.

141
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:16,750
Fine. When can I see her?

142
00:06:16,784 --> 00:06:19,686
She's lost her
visitation privileges.

143
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,555
Wait. Why? For how long?

144
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,923
I have no idea.

145
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,730
We don't do, like,
frappuccino's here.

146
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,599
We do caramel cappuccinos,

147
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:34,701
and then we have, like,
assorted americanos.

148
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:37,737
You do know what an
americano is, don't you?

149
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,673
Yeah. I know.

150
00:06:39,707 --> 00:06:43,643
Good, good. You are gonna be
a barista soon enough.

151
00:06:43,678 --> 00:06:45,779
Awesome.

152
00:06:47,048 --> 00:06:49,816
Make me proud.

153
00:06:56,724 --> 00:06:58,859
Are you Emily fields?

154
00:06:58,893 --> 00:07:00,794
Yes.

155
00:07:00,828 --> 00:07:03,897
I called your house and
your m said you worked here.

156
00:07:03,931 --> 00:07:05,665
I'm Maya's cousin, Nate.

157
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,635
You have time to talk?

158
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:11,004
Um...

159
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:18,512
I'm sorry. It's my first day
here, so can I call you later?

160
00:07:18,546 --> 00:07:20,680
Yeah, any time.
I'll give you my number.

161
00:07:20,715 --> 00:07:22,516
I live here now.

162
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,950
In Rosewood?

163
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,819
Just started at Hollis.

164
00:07:25,853 --> 00:07:28,855
Maya never mentioned she had
a cousin coming to Hollis.

165
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:32,559
Well, I applied but I hadn't
gotten in yet when she was...

166
00:07:35,763 --> 00:07:37,797
I was actually
really looking forward

167
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,733
to hanging out with her again.

168
00:07:43,571 --> 00:07:45,605
Hey, Emily.
Go time.

169
00:07:46,974 --> 00:07:48,875
Talk to you soon.

170
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:53,914
Green tea latte drinkers.

171
00:07:53,948 --> 00:07:55,949
Yeah? So get the gluten-free
biscottis going.

172
00:07:55,983 --> 00:07:59,786
Gluten-free biscottis.

173
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:04,791
There's nothing else
you can do about it?

174
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:06,893
Yeah, I understand.

175
00:08:06,928 --> 00:08:09,596
Um...

176
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,500
I guess, just let me
know if anything changes.

177
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,768
All right, thanks.

178
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:20,807
Next Saturday.
You, me, the tenth row.

179
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:23,610
Bon iver.

180
00:08:23,644 --> 00:08:24,978
Don't worry.

181
00:08:25,012 --> 00:08:26,746
I'll think of a way that
you can thank me later.

182
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:28,582
Oh.

183
00:08:28,616 --> 00:08:29,950
Okay, this is the part where
you're supposed to scream,

184
00:08:29,984 --> 00:08:31,518
jump up and kiss me.

185
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,485
What's going on?

186
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,820
I just got off
the phone with wren

187
00:08:33,854 --> 00:08:35,655
and he told me that
Mona freaked out

188
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,657
after some guy went to
visit her the other day.

189
00:08:37,692 --> 00:08:39,593
And now I can't
see her anymore.

190
00:08:39,627 --> 00:08:43,763
I mean, seriously,
I'm going to kill Lucas.

191
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:47,834
It wasn't Lucas.
It was me.

192
00:08:47,868 --> 00:08:50,637
What?

193
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:51,905
Why would you go
there without me?

194
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:54,608
Because I needed
to talk to her.

195
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:55,742
About what?

196
00:08:55,776 --> 00:08:58,511
Nothing. Much.

197
00:08:58,546 --> 00:08:59,779
Really.

198
00:08:59,814 --> 00:09:01,648
I told her to just
stop messing with you.

199
00:09:01,682 --> 00:09:02,749
Wait, messing with me?

200
00:09:02,783 --> 00:09:04,818
Yeah, before I knew it,
she was flipping tables

201
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:06,519
and acting like she
was possessed.

202
00:09:06,554 --> 00:09:09,522
Mona is in radley under
24-hour supervision.

203
00:09:09,557 --> 00:09:11,725
All right? She's not doing
anything to hurt me.

204
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,760
Yes, she is.
You just don't see it.

205
00:09:13,794 --> 00:09:15,895
You have to trust that
I know what I'm doing.

206
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,598
Hanna, if you were
popping pills everyday,

207
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:19,899
would you want me to
just look the other way?

208
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:20,900
That's not the same thing.

209
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,669
It is exactly the same thing.

210
00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:24,838
Wren thinks it's good
if I go talk to her.

211
00:09:24,872 --> 00:09:26,573
He said it's helping me heal.

212
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,741
Why are you listening
to some guy you barely know,

213
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,908
instead of me?

214
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,544
Because I obviously can't
talk to you about this.

215
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:33,613
You've already made up
your mind about Mona.

216
00:09:33,648 --> 00:09:36,583
Wren doesn't know
everything that I know.

217
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,884
Unless there's something
that you're not telling me.

218
00:09:37,918 --> 00:09:39,586
No, of course not.

219
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,854
Then you need to stay
away from radley.

220
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:44,524
Look, I get that you're trying
to help me here, but you're not.

221
00:09:44,558 --> 00:09:45,959
So just do me a favor
and stay out of it.

222
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:05,642
You both just need
a little time to cool off.

223
00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:07,878
Caleb's not gonna be
cooling off any time soon.

224
00:10:07,912 --> 00:10:10,781
He doesn't understand
why I need to see Mona,

225
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,883
and it's killing me
not to tell him.

226
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:13,984
Maybe you should.

227
00:10:14,018 --> 00:10:16,653
Maybe I should what?

228
00:10:16,688 --> 00:10:17,988
Tell him why
you're going there,

229
00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:21,592
and about this "A".

230
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:23,694
Wait, are you serious?

231
00:10:23,728 --> 00:10:25,929
Look, if it were me,

232
00:10:25,964 --> 00:10:27,865
I would ezra about "A".

233
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,032
I'd have to.

234
00:10:35,874 --> 00:10:37,941
Why are you looking at
pictures of bald, fat men?

235
00:10:37,976 --> 00:10:40,878
I'm looking for
a guy for my mom.

236
00:10:40,912 --> 00:10:43,814
I don't know, I just thought
she could try out online dating.

237
00:10:43,848 --> 00:10:47,851
She's divorced,
she's not desperate.

238
00:10:47,886 --> 00:10:52,823
You didn't tell your mom about
your dad and Meredith, did you?

239
00:10:52,857 --> 00:10:55,058
I just thought it would be
easier for her to hear

240
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:56,960
if she had already
met someone else.

241
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:58,662
Look, all right,
your mom's a catch.

242
00:10:58,696 --> 00:11:00,631
Okay? She can meet
someone in person.

243
00:11:00,665 --> 00:11:02,532
She doesn't have
to do it online.

244
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:04,001
Hey, girls.

245
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:06,770
Hey, mom.
Hi.

246
00:11:06,804 --> 00:11:09,606
Okay, what don't
you want me to see?

247
00:11:09,641 --> 00:11:10,607
Nothing.

248
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:13,043
No more secrets, remember?

249
00:11:19,984 --> 00:11:21,818
Should I be worried?

250
00:11:21,853 --> 00:11:24,721
I'm trying to find
a guy for my mom.

251
00:11:24,756 --> 00:11:28,792
Yeah, preferably someone
who doesn't look like a grape.

252
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,898
He's cute. Sort of.

253
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:38,568
Mom, he has a unibrow.

254
00:11:38,603 --> 00:11:41,772
Tell your mom to use
mainlinemate.

255
00:11:41,806 --> 00:11:44,641
It's a much better site.

256
00:11:50,748 --> 00:11:53,083
All right, see you next week.

257
00:12:02,593 --> 00:12:04,561
Hey, Jason.
Hey.

258
00:12:04,595 --> 00:12:05,629
How's it going?

259
00:12:05,663 --> 00:12:06,763
I've been better.

260
00:12:06,798 --> 00:12:08,699
There any calls
on the flyer yet?

261
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:10,801
Your mom send you here
to ask me that?

262
00:12:10,835 --> 00:12:12,602
Jason, you are upset.

263
00:12:12,637 --> 00:12:14,571
I want to make sure
that you're okay.

264
00:12:14,605 --> 00:12:15,906
Nothing solid
to go on just yet.

265
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,874
Maybe you should
withdraw the reward.

266
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:19,676
Just let the police
handle this.

267
00:12:19,711 --> 00:12:22,612
Why? Because they handled
Ali's murder case so well?

268
00:12:22,647 --> 00:12:24,014
No, because you don't
need to be fielding calls

269
00:12:24,048 --> 00:12:25,983
from every crackpot in town
who's just looking for money.

270
00:12:26,017 --> 00:12:28,919
Look, all I need is one
to tell me the truth.

271
00:12:28,953 --> 00:12:30,554
How are you gonna kvow
if they're for real

272
00:12:30,588 --> 00:12:31,588
or if they just want a reward?

273
00:12:31,622 --> 00:12:32,889
I can tell when
someone's lying.

274
00:12:32,924 --> 00:12:34,691
Can you?

275
00:12:34,726 --> 00:12:35,892
What is that supposed to mean?

276
00:12:35,927 --> 00:12:37,728
Why do you think your
mom took this case?

277
00:12:37,762 --> 00:12:41,898
'Cause she has a reason to
believe that Garrett's innocent.

278
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:43,667
Or maybe she just
doesn't want to see

279
00:12:43,701 --> 00:12:45,635
the precious Hastings
name get tarnished.

280
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,803
You think that she's
trying to protect someone?

281
00:12:46,838 --> 00:12:48,638
I think your mom has an agenda

282
00:12:48,673 --> 00:12:50,040
that has nothing to do with criminal defense.

283
00:12:50,074 --> 00:12:51,875
Are you talking about Melissa?

284
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:54,845
I gotta take this.

285
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,749
Yeah?

286
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:02,886
Gourmet chef?

287
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,755
What? She is in my house.

288
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:05,722
Oh.

289
00:13:06,991 --> 00:13:08,925
Athletic?

290
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,994
All right, does your mom even
own a pair of sneakers?

291
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:12,929
Okay, everybody
exaggerates on this thing.

292
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:14,831
I read it in <i>cosmo.</i>

293
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:17,667
Sit down. Help me
figure out a username.

294
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,737
Um...

295
00:13:20,772 --> 00:13:24,641
Oh! How 'bout
"Rosewoodgirl"?

296
00:13:24,675 --> 00:13:26,977
Lame.

297
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:29,946
"Artlover"?
Boring.

298
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:37,888
I got one.
"Hotmama".

299
00:13:37,922 --> 00:13:40,657
"Hotmama"?
Mm-hmm.

300
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:43,794
I'm trying to get my mom a date
with a man, not a frat boy.

301
00:13:43,828 --> 00:13:47,731
Trust me, Aria.
This is going to work.

302
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:51,068
Hotmama.

303
00:14:04,782 --> 00:14:07,617
Hi.

304
00:14:07,652 --> 00:14:08,952
Thanks for coming.

305
00:14:08,986 --> 00:14:12,689
Uh, so do you live on campus?

306
00:14:12,723 --> 00:14:14,825
I got a studio
near the college.

307
00:14:14,859 --> 00:14:16,626
Dorms aren't really my thing.

308
00:14:16,661 --> 00:14:17,961
Yeah.

309
00:14:20,598 --> 00:14:24,968
Maya sent me a picture of you.

310
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:29,739
Yeah, I sent that to her
when she was at tru north.

311
00:14:29,774 --> 00:14:32,642
I know it's not their fault,

312
00:14:32,677 --> 00:14:34,744
but I keep thinking if her
parents hadn't threatened

313
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:37,747
to send her back there,
she'd still be here.

314
00:14:37,782 --> 00:14:41,551
I sent her mom a few emails,
but she never responded to me.

315
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:42,919
They're totally
shut down right now.

316
00:14:42,954 --> 00:14:45,021
It's all just too much.

317
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:47,023
I was just hoping they'd have
some kind of service here.

318
00:14:47,058 --> 00:14:49,993
The funeral was small,
just family.

319
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:53,663
Well, I never got
to say goodbye.

320
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:56,733
That's sort of why I called.

321
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,936
Maya's mom asked me
to give you this.

322
00:14:59,971 --> 00:15:03,673
It was delivered a few
weeks after the funeral.

323
00:15:25,563 --> 00:15:29,633
We saw this movie
on our first date.

324
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:32,936
Actually, we didn't really
see that much of the movie.

325
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,739
Sounds like
my kind of first date.

326
00:16:09,607 --> 00:16:11,975
Hey, I understand you're a cop,

327
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:14,544
but you still can't
go in there.

328
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:16,646
Well, this court
order says I can.

329
00:16:18,683 --> 00:16:19,816
How long will you be?

330
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,786
As long as it takes.

331
00:16:29,894 --> 00:16:32,662
Hello, Mona.
Remember me?

332
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:37,601
Maya said you were a swimmer.

333
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,975
What's your stroke?
Butterfly? Free style?

334
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:42,511
Free style. Yeah.
You swim?

335
00:16:42,545 --> 00:16:43,879
I was all-conference
in high school.

336
00:16:43,913 --> 00:16:45,647
Oh. Impressive.

337
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:47,649
Swimming definitely
wasn't Maya's thing.

338
00:16:47,683 --> 00:16:48,984
Unless there were
floaties involved.

339
00:16:50,786 --> 00:16:51,953
Our cousins used to
always get together

340
00:16:51,988 --> 00:16:54,523
every summer for a few
weeks at my grandpa's.

341
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:55,724
Stinson beach, right?

342
00:16:55,758 --> 00:16:58,894
One day, all the guys
decided that we would swim

343
00:16:58,928 --> 00:17:00,929
from the beach
to the dock and back.

344
00:17:00,963 --> 00:17:02,797
It's about a mile each way.

345
00:17:02,832 --> 00:17:05,700
And Maya insisted
on joining us.

346
00:17:05,735 --> 00:17:07,802
But after a few minutes,
she started fading fast.

347
00:17:07,837 --> 00:17:09,771
Wanted to prove she
could hang with the boys,

348
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:12,574
so she decided if she
couldn't swim, she'd row.

349
00:17:12,608 --> 00:17:13,909
Got in her canoe and
rode all the way there.

350
00:17:13,943 --> 00:17:15,777
She beat us too.

351
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:18,914
It became a daily thing.

352
00:17:18,948 --> 00:17:23,685
Every morning, she'd row next
to us to the dock and back.

353
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,624
I should get going.

354
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:30,959
I gotta get to class.

355
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,601
She talked about you
all the time.

356
00:17:39,635 --> 00:17:42,003
Said you were her
first real love.

357
00:17:47,743 --> 00:17:48,710
Hey, Nate.

358
00:17:48,744 --> 00:17:50,946
Do you have her
parents' address?

359
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,847
I'd like to send them
a thank-you note.

360
00:17:52,882 --> 00:17:55,517
Don't have it with me.
Can I get it to you later?

361
00:17:55,551 --> 00:17:56,851
Yeah, sure.

362
00:17:56,886 --> 00:17:59,754
I'm glad I finally
got to meet you.

363
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:02,524
Me too.

364
00:18:20,743 --> 00:18:24,579
He's still downstairs
talking to her.

365
00:18:24,614 --> 00:18:25,814
About what?

366
00:18:25,848 --> 00:18:27,582
He's been in there
for over an hour.

367
00:18:27,617 --> 00:18:29,718
Something to do with
Alison's missing remains.

368
00:18:29,752 --> 00:18:31,853
No, Mona doesn't know
anything about that.

369
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:33,622
She's been in here
the last five months.

370
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:34,889
Well, a judge doesn't
issue an oer like that

371
00:18:34,924 --> 00:18:36,625
unless there's
a pretty good reason.

372
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:40,629
Look, can't you just
sneak me in there?

373
00:18:40,663 --> 00:18:42,597
I just have to see her.

374
00:18:42,632 --> 00:18:43,898
I have one question.
I'll be really quick.

375
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:48,703
Oh, I know. I'd love to help.
But my hands are tied.

376
00:18:48,738 --> 00:18:51,706
I already got reprimanded
by her primary last week

377
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:52,907
for extending
your visiting hours.

378
00:18:52,942 --> 00:18:54,542
I didn't know you did that.

379
00:18:54,577 --> 00:18:56,511
I didn't think you needed to.

380
00:18:56,545 --> 00:18:57,846
So why did you do it?

381
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,583
Well, I saw you together
and thought you were connecting.

382
00:19:01,617 --> 00:19:02,884
Thank you.

383
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,456
He was there with
a court order to talk to her.

384
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:10,825
So what do you think
Mona said to wilden?

385
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,395
If she knows that we were at
Ali's grave that night...

386
00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:14,829
we would be in jail right now.

387
00:19:16,565 --> 00:19:18,433
You guys, we need to find out
who the black swan is.

388
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:19,634
Like, now.

389
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:21,636
I think we need to find out
when Melissa lost her baby.

390
00:19:21,671 --> 00:19:22,804
Yeah, she's right, Spence.

391
00:19:22,838 --> 00:19:24,572
Melissa lied for a reason.

392
00:19:24,607 --> 00:19:25,740
We need to find out what it is.

393
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:27,809
Yeah, but we know
why Mona hated us.

394
00:19:27,843 --> 00:19:29,878
Why would my sister
wanna torture us?

395
00:19:29,912 --> 00:19:31,713
Because you made out
with her fiance

396
00:19:31,747 --> 00:19:32,881
and broke up their engagement.

397
00:19:32,915 --> 00:19:34,616
Okay, yeah, but that was me.

398
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,884
And she knows that
we have the video

399
00:19:35,918 --> 00:19:38,586
that puts her in Ali's room
the night that she was murdered.

400
00:19:38,621 --> 00:19:40,689
And she fits the costume.

401
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,829
Going to Philly.

402
00:19:56,739 --> 00:20:01,443
It just never seems
to end for that family.

403
00:20:01,477 --> 00:20:02,844
Or our daughters.

404
00:20:02,878 --> 00:20:05,647
First Alison then Maya.

405
00:20:05,681 --> 00:20:07,816
I'm sorry.
Your takeout.

406
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,617
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

407
00:20:09,652 --> 00:20:12,620
So are you meeting someone?
A date?

408
00:20:12,655 --> 00:20:15,423
No.

409
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,560
I haven't been on a date since
George clooney was <i>E.R.</i>

410
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:20,595
I was hoping you might've met

411
00:20:20,629 --> 00:20:22,664
someone interesting
on mainlinemate.

412
00:20:22,698 --> 00:20:25,867
Mainlinemate?
What's that?

413
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:53,762
Hello?

414
00:20:53,796 --> 00:20:55,797
Hey. Melissa just left.
Should we go in?

415
00:20:55,831 --> 00:20:58,466
No, just wait. I'll text
you when she gets here.

416
00:20:58,501 --> 00:20:59,801
All right.
Roger that.

417
00:20:59,835 --> 00:21:01,703
"Roger that?"

418
00:21:01,737 --> 00:21:03,671
What? We're on a mission.

419
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,808
Thank you.

420
00:21:06,842 --> 00:21:09,711
"Hotmama loves tango?"

421
00:21:09,745 --> 00:21:12,614
I'm going to kill Aria.

422
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:13,782
How do I delete this?

423
00:21:13,816 --> 00:21:15,617
No, I wouldn't do that.

424
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:18,787
I know there's some
strange people on here,

425
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:21,422
but did you know
that Jane foster

426
00:21:21,457 --> 00:21:23,525
met her second and her third
husbands on this site?

427
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:24,659
Perfect.

428
00:21:24,693 --> 00:21:26,661
Seriously.

429
00:21:26,695 --> 00:21:28,730
I've met some good guys too.

430
00:21:28,764 --> 00:21:31,766
It's not easy to do at our age.

431
00:21:31,801 --> 00:21:32,834
The pool we're swimming in

432
00:21:32,868 --> 00:21:34,669
is much shallower
than it used to be.

433
00:21:34,703 --> 00:21:36,905
I don't know. It seems like
hatf of this town is divorced.

434
00:21:36,939 --> 00:21:42,510
Well, most of the men our age
want someone their age.

435
00:21:42,545 --> 00:21:44,512
Mm-hmm.

436
00:21:44,547 --> 00:21:47,549
Honestly...

437
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,584
Dating isn't even on my mind.

438
00:21:49,618 --> 00:21:51,719
I'm just trying to adjust
to all the changes.

439
00:21:51,754 --> 00:21:54,455
I remember the feeling.

440
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,458
Do you know I do not even
know how to barbecue?

441
00:21:57,493 --> 00:21:58,793
Or fix a toilet?

442
00:21:58,828 --> 00:22:01,529
Mine ran for three
hours last night

443
00:22:01,564 --> 00:22:04,465
until my neighbor came over
to ask if he could fix it

444
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,501
because the noise
was keeping him awake.

445
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:07,735
Well, some of the things
you figure out

446
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,404
more quickly than others.

447
00:22:09,438 --> 00:22:10,705
And those that you don't,

448
00:22:10,739 --> 00:22:12,674
you figure out who to call
to figure it out for you.

449
00:22:14,443 --> 00:22:16,544
I think the hardest part for me

450
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:20,481
was not having someone to
share the little stuff with.

451
00:22:20,516 --> 00:22:23,651
For me, it's sleeping at night.

452
00:22:23,686 --> 00:22:26,821
I still curl up
into my little area.

453
00:22:26,856 --> 00:22:28,556
And one morning you wake up

454
00:22:28,591 --> 00:22:31,359
and you'll realize you're
on the other side of the bed.

455
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:33,695
And how long did
that take for you?

456
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:37,365
Longer than I care to admit.

457
00:22:39,869 --> 00:22:41,502
Oh, look.

458
00:22:41,537 --> 00:22:43,805
It's a message from
mainlinemate.

459
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:47,408
Frankie d. Wants
to meet me for coffee.

460
00:22:47,443 --> 00:22:48,476
Oh.

461
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,644
He has a full head of hair,

462
00:22:49,678 --> 00:22:52,847
owns his own home,
and drives a red corvette.

463
00:22:52,882 --> 00:22:54,515
Wow.

464
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,718
I'll share him with you.

465
00:22:56,752 --> 00:22:58,453
No, thanks.

466
00:22:59,555 --> 00:23:00,788
You sure?
No, thank you.

467
00:23:00,823 --> 00:23:03,424
But wow.

468
00:23:03,459 --> 00:23:05,360
Yeah.

469
00:23:05,394 --> 00:23:06,794
All right, you guys,
it's been 20 minutes.

470
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:08,363
We should just go in.

471
00:23:08,397 --> 00:23:09,530
Spencer hasn't texted yet.

472
00:23:09,565 --> 00:23:10,698
She will any minute.

473
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:12,767
Let's find out when
she lost that baby.

474
00:23:40,596 --> 00:23:42,730
What exactly
are we looking for?

475
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:44,799
Medical records.
Anything with a date on it.

476
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,668
I'm gonna go check the bedroom.

477
00:24:12,428 --> 00:24:13,795
Okay, there's
nothing in the bedroom.

478
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:15,797
Is this anything?

479
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:18,366
Yeah, her car insurance.

480
00:24:21,403 --> 00:24:23,438
Melissa bought
a pair of Chloe boots

481
00:24:23,472 --> 00:24:24,806
from saks last
week for 900 bucks.

482
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,408
Okay, now those I wanna see.

483
00:24:27,443 --> 00:24:30,745
I wanna find her
fake baby bump.

484
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:33,581
What? Aren't you curious?
It has to be here somewhere.

485
00:24:33,615 --> 00:24:34,649
Gross.

486
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,521
Oh, my God. She's even
more anal than Spencer.

487
00:24:40,556 --> 00:24:42,357
I didn't even think
that was possible.

488
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,695
And, yet it is.

489
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,664
Oh, my God.

490
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:50,698
What?
It's Melissa!

491
00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:52,633
Where?
Outside.

492
00:24:52,668 --> 00:24:54,469
Put everything back.
What do we do?

493
00:24:54,503 --> 00:24:55,503
Put everything back
where you found it.

494
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:13,287
Dammit!

495
00:25:13,322 --> 00:25:15,490
Hanna.

496
00:26:28,464 --> 00:26:29,597
That was close.
Yeah, way too close.

497
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:31,532
Okay, let's just
get out of here.

498
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:32,633
We need to hang these up.

499
00:26:32,668 --> 00:26:35,369
Wait, you guys.
Look.

500
00:26:47,716 --> 00:26:49,650
Wait.

501
00:26:58,895 --> 00:27:01,863
It matches the one Hanna found
at the masquerade ball.

502
00:27:04,107 --> 00:27:07,007
You know what they say,
if the feather fits.

503
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,574
Hanna, it's the shoe.
If the shoe fits.

504
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:10,509
Whatever. Melissa's "A".

505
00:27:10,543 --> 00:27:12,611
Guys, I know that
she looks suspicious.

506
00:27:12,645 --> 00:27:13,812
Okay, but we're
still just guessing.

507
00:27:13,846 --> 00:27:15,781
Well it's a guess
I'm willing to take.

508
00:27:15,815 --> 00:27:17,683
Me too.

509
00:27:18,918 --> 00:27:20,919
Fine, I'll go back to Philly.

510
00:27:20,953 --> 00:27:22,954
Mm-mmm.
You're not going alone.

511
00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:25,590
If Melissa is who
we think she is,

512
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,526
then she's dangerous.

513
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,630
Like, "probably had something to
do with Ali's murder" dangerous.

514
00:27:31,664 --> 00:27:33,699
She's not just trying
to hurt you, Spence.

515
00:27:33,733 --> 00:27:36,768
She's after all of us.

516
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:43,508
Well, em gets off at 8:00,
so pick her up,

517
00:27:43,543 --> 00:27:44,910
and then we'll all go together.

518
00:27:55,555 --> 00:27:57,789
Want to help me
get dinner started?

519
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:01,626
I thought you were staying
in Philly for the week.

520
00:28:01,661 --> 00:28:02,928
I decided to come back for mom.

521
00:28:02,962 --> 00:28:04,596
For mom?

522
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,932
It was pretty humiliating what
Jason did to her at the grill.

523
00:28:06,966 --> 00:28:08,533
He lives next door to us.

524
00:28:08,568 --> 00:28:10,569
Who knows what this
person's gonna do next.

525
00:28:10,603 --> 00:28:12,604
He's our brother, Melissa.

526
00:28:12,638 --> 00:28:14,706
I was trying to be polite.

527
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,752
I know that you were
dressed as the black swan

528
00:28:26,786 --> 00:28:28,687
at the masquerade ball.

529
00:28:28,721 --> 00:28:31,823
And I know that you didn't
lose the baby in June.

530
00:28:34,961 --> 00:28:37,662
Oh, God.
Please say something.

531
00:28:37,697 --> 00:28:39,498
Melissa.

532
00:28:39,532 --> 00:28:40,966
When did you lose the baby?

533
00:28:44,537 --> 00:28:45,837
The day after
I found Ian's body.

534
00:28:45,872 --> 00:28:49,541
What? How could
you not tell me?

535
00:28:49,575 --> 00:28:50,675
I tried to!

536
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,777
When? When did you try?

537
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:53,645
The night of Ian's funeral.

538
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:54,946
But then I saw his
phone in your bag

539
00:28:54,981 --> 00:28:57,616
and I thought you were the
one sending me those texts.

540
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:00,585
Why would you fake
being pregnant?

541
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,655
I lost Ian!
I lost the baby.

542
00:29:03,689 --> 00:29:04,723
It was too much.

543
00:29:04,757 --> 00:29:06,892
So you pretended?

544
00:29:06,926 --> 00:29:08,894
My whole life was
in the papers.

545
00:29:08,928 --> 00:29:10,829
I couldn't deal with this
getting out there too.

546
00:29:14,634 --> 00:29:16,735
At least that's how it started.

547
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:21,807
You had to know that
this couldn't last, right?

548
00:29:28,714 --> 00:29:31,817
Why were you at
the masquerade ball?

549
00:29:31,851 --> 00:29:35,554
I'd like to know the answer
to that myself.

550
00:29:37,824 --> 00:29:39,825
So, I decided to do it.

551
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:41,726
My mom's out.

552
00:29:41,761 --> 00:29:43,795
I'm gonna tell Caleb tonight.

553
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:47,799
I refuse to let this "A"
play divide and conquer.

554
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:50,869
Oh. What time
is he coming over?

555
00:29:52,572 --> 00:29:53,638
Hey, that's probably him.
I'll call you back.

556
00:29:53,673 --> 00:29:54,739
Okay.

557
00:30:15,831 --> 00:30:18,832
One morning, there was a package in the
hallway outside my apartment.

558
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:21,634
The black swan dress
was in it with a note

559
00:30:21,668 --> 00:30:22,868
telling me to wear
it to the ball,

560
00:30:22,903 --> 00:30:26,005
or everyone would find out
I was lying about the baby.

561
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,674
Why didn't you tell anyone?

562
00:30:28,709 --> 00:30:32,578
Who? You? Mom? Dad?

563
00:30:32,612 --> 00:30:34,780
Garrett had just been arrested,

564
00:30:34,815 --> 00:30:38,584
I was scared and now someone
was blackmailing me.

565
00:30:38,618 --> 00:30:42,855
So I put on the dress
and I went to the ball.

566
00:30:42,889 --> 00:30:44,657
Why were you talking to Jenna?

567
00:30:44,691 --> 00:30:47,626
The note said to distract
Jenna at the ball.

568
00:30:47,661 --> 00:30:50,629
But then I saw your
friends and I... I ran out.

569
00:30:50,664 --> 00:30:53,666
Who would blackmail you?

570
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,835
I'm assuming it was Mona.

571
00:30:55,869 --> 00:30:57,703
She was taken to
radley that night

572
00:30:57,738 --> 00:31:01,674
and I never got another
note or a threat again.

573
00:31:04,878 --> 00:31:06,746
Now that this is all
out in the open,

574
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,583
I'm hoping we can
put this behind us.

575
00:31:10,617 --> 00:31:13,586
I'm going upstairs.
I need to lie down.

576
00:31:25,031 --> 00:31:26,899
Who else knows that
she was faking it?

577
00:31:29,703 --> 00:31:30,770
Your father.

578
00:31:34,941 --> 00:31:36,642
And Garrett.

579
00:31:36,676 --> 00:31:39,979
Wait, so that's
why you took the case?

580
00:31:40,013 --> 00:31:41,747
'Cause Garrett's
blackmailing you?

581
00:31:41,782 --> 00:31:43,616
It's not that.
Then why?

582
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:46,018
Mom, you better
tell me right now,

583
00:31:46,052 --> 00:31:47,953
or I swear to God, I'm gonna
walk out of that door

584
00:31:47,988 --> 00:31:49,054
and I'm not gonna come back.

585
00:31:51,892 --> 00:31:55,728
Garrett told me that
his public defender

586
00:31:55,762 --> 00:31:58,798
was putting together
a list of defense witnesses.

587
00:31:58,832 --> 00:32:00,733
I recognized one of the names.

588
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:05,805
The p.I. That your
father and I had hired to...

589
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:08,941
Watch Melissa after
Alison went missing.

590
00:32:08,975 --> 00:32:11,710
And he found something
about Melissa.

591
00:32:11,745 --> 00:32:13,546
Your sister had nothing
to do with the murder.

592
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,882
But if a jury found out
that we'd hired someone

593
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:20,786
and learned that she was
faking her pregnancy,

594
00:32:20,821 --> 00:32:23,789
then they'd instantly think that
she was guilty of something.

595
00:32:23,824 --> 00:32:26,725
Mom?

596
00:32:29,763 --> 00:32:32,665
Spencer, you can't tell anyone.

597
00:32:37,904 --> 00:32:41,674
Like it or not,
this is your family.

598
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,924
Hey.

599
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:01,560
Hi.

600
00:33:01,595 --> 00:33:02,728
You okay?

601
00:33:02,762 --> 00:33:04,930
Not really.

602
00:33:04,965 --> 00:33:06,832
My mom was in a car accident.

603
00:33:06,867 --> 00:33:09,602
Oh, my God.

604
00:33:09,636 --> 00:33:11,737
Wait, when did this happen?
Is she okay?

605
00:33:11,771 --> 00:33:14,540
Yeah, she's lucky.

606
00:33:14,574 --> 00:33:15,641
Could've been a lot worse.

607
00:33:15,675 --> 00:33:17,509
She was in Montecito.

608
00:33:17,544 --> 00:33:18,611
Yeah.

609
00:33:18,645 --> 00:33:19,745
It's pretty screwed up though.

610
00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:20,846
She said that she
felt like someone

611
00:33:20,881 --> 00:33:22,648
was trying to run
her off the road.

612
00:33:24,651 --> 00:33:26,986
I can't believe
somebody would do that.

613
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,522
Yeah, me neither.

614
00:33:30,557 --> 00:33:32,925
Anyway, you said you had
something to tell me?

615
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:35,728
Yeah, um...

616
00:33:35,762 --> 00:33:38,731
Yeah, I thought I'd be
able to talk about it, but.

617
00:33:38,765 --> 00:33:39,932
But what?

618
00:33:39,966 --> 00:33:42,601
Right now is not
really a good time.

619
00:33:42,636 --> 00:33:45,738
I don't understand.

620
00:33:47,874 --> 00:33:51,543
First, you tell me that you're
hiding something from me.

621
00:33:51,578 --> 00:33:53,879
And now you're saying that
you can't tell me what that is.

622
00:33:53,914 --> 00:33:56,849
Caleb, it's nothing.
Really.

623
00:33:56,883 --> 00:33:58,951
Hanna...

624
00:33:58,985 --> 00:34:03,656
I understand that when
you lied to me last year,

625
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:04,790
you were trying to protect me.

626
00:34:04,824 --> 00:34:08,594
But there's no more "A".

627
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:13,999
So why are you lying to me now?

628
00:34:16,569 --> 00:34:17,903
Is this about Mona?

629
00:34:17,938 --> 00:34:19,638
No.

630
00:34:19,673 --> 00:34:20,673
Then what?

631
00:34:20,707 --> 00:34:22,641
Could we just drop it?

632
00:34:27,814 --> 00:34:29,648
Caleb, where are you going?

633
00:34:30,917 --> 00:34:34,553
I can't do this anymore.

634
00:34:34,587 --> 00:34:35,854
Can't do what?

635
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:37,623
This.

636
00:34:39,626 --> 00:34:43,662
I feel like you've been
pushing me away for weeks.

637
00:34:43,697 --> 00:34:45,531
And I just...
I keep hoping that things

638
00:34:45,565 --> 00:34:47,733
are going to go back
to the way that they were.

639
00:34:47,767 --> 00:34:49,868
But, clearly,
that's not going to happen.

640
00:34:49,903 --> 00:34:51,870
You just gotta be
patient with me right now.

641
00:34:51,905 --> 00:34:54,740
Hanna, I have been nothing
but patient with you.

642
00:34:57,777 --> 00:35:02,815
I feel like I only exist
in half of your life.

643
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:04,850
And that's not
good enough for me.

644
00:35:08,822 --> 00:35:12,591
You have to give
me something here.

645
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,731
More silence.

646
00:35:21,701 --> 00:35:24,737
Great.

647
00:35:29,642 --> 00:35:32,711
I'm done, Hanna.

648
00:35:36,649 --> 00:35:38,884
What do you mean, you're done?

649
00:35:38,918 --> 00:35:41,820
Are you...

650
00:35:41,855 --> 00:35:44,823
are you breaking up with me?

651
00:35:50,697 --> 00:35:54,700
You're hardly giving me much
of a choice, are you?

652
00:36:09,056 --> 00:36:12,091
Come in.

653
00:36:12,126 --> 00:36:14,727
Hey.

654
00:36:14,762 --> 00:36:15,862
What're you doing here?

655
00:36:15,896 --> 00:36:16,896
I thought we were doing
dinner tomorrow night.

656
00:36:16,931 --> 00:36:18,731
We are.
I just stopped by

657
00:36:18,766 --> 00:36:20,066
to get some things
for the apartment

658
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,868
and I saw your light on.

659
00:36:21,902 --> 00:36:22,835
Can we talk?

660
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:23,770
Sure.

661
00:36:23,804 --> 00:36:26,839
I saw my online dating profile.

662
00:36:26,874 --> 00:36:28,708
Oh.

663
00:36:28,742 --> 00:36:30,076
Look, mom,

664
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,945
I... I can explain that.

665
00:36:31,979 --> 00:36:34,814
You know, part of me is angry

666
00:36:34,848 --> 00:36:36,983
that you inserted yourself
into my personal life,

667
00:36:37,017 --> 00:36:38,918
and the other part
of me realizes

668
00:36:38,953 --> 00:36:41,054
that you were just
trying to help.

669
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,690
I'm sorry. Really.

670
00:36:43,724 --> 00:36:44,891
I know that I shouldn't
have done it.

671
00:36:44,925 --> 00:36:47,927
I just... I thought it would
be nice if you met someone.

672
00:36:47,962 --> 00:36:49,929
Especially since dad's...

673
00:36:49,964 --> 00:36:51,864
seeing Meredith again?

674
00:36:51,899 --> 00:36:53,132
You know about that?

675
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:54,968
I do.

676
00:36:55,002 --> 00:36:57,170
And I'm okay with it.

677
00:36:57,204 --> 00:36:58,771
You are?

678
00:36:58,806 --> 00:37:00,873
Yeah. We're not
together anymore.

679
00:37:00,908 --> 00:37:02,942
He can date whoever
he wants to date.

680
00:37:02,977 --> 00:37:05,044
I meani wish it
was somebody else,

681
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:07,013
but, what am I gonna do?

682
00:37:07,047 --> 00:37:09,916
I was worried about you.

683
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,651
I want you to be happy.

684
00:37:11,685 --> 00:37:14,020
It's been a couple of
overwhelming months for me

685
00:37:14,054 --> 00:37:15,955
and I'm doing my best
to get through it,

686
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,791
but that doesn't mean
that I'm lonely,

687
00:37:18,826 --> 00:37:20,760
or dying for companionship.

688
00:37:20,794 --> 00:37:21,894
You're not?

689
00:37:21,929 --> 00:37:23,663
No. I've been a wife

690
00:37:23,697 --> 00:37:25,898
and a mom my entire adult life

691
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:29,002
and I'm looking forward to
getting to a common place

692
00:37:29,036 --> 00:37:31,971
and having some time for myself

693
00:37:32,006 --> 00:37:34,874
before I add somebody
else to that equation.

694
00:37:34,908 --> 00:37:36,876
You can understand that, right?

695
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,878
Yes.

696
00:37:38,912 --> 00:37:41,914
And, by the way,
"hotmama", really?

697
00:37:41,949 --> 00:37:42,949
Seriously?

698
00:37:42,983 --> 00:37:44,684
I'm gonna go delete
that right now.

699
00:37:44,718 --> 00:37:46,085
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

700
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,021
Maybe we should leave it up

701
00:37:48,055 --> 00:37:49,822
for a little while.

702
00:38:00,067 --> 00:38:01,768
Oh, thanks.

703
00:38:01,802 --> 00:38:02,969
No problem.

704
00:38:03,003 --> 00:38:07,907
I just realized I forgot Maya's
parents address in my car.

705
00:38:09,743 --> 00:38:11,678
Felt good writing it.

706
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,813
It's kind of like the
goodbye I never had.

707
00:38:13,847 --> 00:38:16,716
I'm actually mailing a package
to them in the morning.

708
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,917
Want me to just
add it in there?

709
00:38:17,951 --> 00:38:20,953
Sure. Thanks.
I have to get going.

710
00:38:20,988 --> 00:38:22,021
I'm meeting some friends,

711
00:38:22,056 --> 00:38:24,757
but we should grab
a bite sometime.

712
00:38:24,792 --> 00:38:26,793
Yeah, sure.
If I'm still around.

713
00:38:26,827 --> 00:38:27,927
Where are you going?

714
00:38:27,961 --> 00:38:29,796
Thinking about heading home.

715
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:30,997
Maybe transferring
somewhere else.

716
00:38:31,031 --> 00:38:32,699
You don't like Hollis?

717
00:38:32,733 --> 00:38:34,901
It's not that,
I just...

718
00:38:34,935 --> 00:38:37,036
I'm having a tough
time settling in.

719
00:38:37,071 --> 00:38:40,973
All anyone seems to talk about
around here is Maya's death.

720
00:38:41,008 --> 00:38:43,042
Big news in a small town.

721
00:38:43,077 --> 00:38:46,112
I get it, but when
I think about Maya,

722
00:38:46,146 --> 00:38:48,948
I wanna think about how she
lived, not how she died.

723
00:38:48,982 --> 00:38:50,850
Yeah.

724
00:38:50,884 --> 00:38:52,719
Losing Maya was
the hardest thing

725
00:38:52,753 --> 00:38:53,953
I've ever had to deal with.

726
00:38:53,987 --> 00:38:56,723
It's turned my
whole world around.

727
00:38:56,757 --> 00:38:58,958
I'm sure it's only
going to get harder

728
00:38:58,992 --> 00:39:00,927
when the trial starts.

729
00:39:02,863 --> 00:39:05,765
But I also know that Maya

730
00:39:05,799 --> 00:39:08,768
wouldn't want you to leave
school because of her.

731
00:39:08,802 --> 00:39:10,670
She'd want you to find a way

732
00:39:10,704 --> 00:39:12,772
to block out the
difficult stuff

733
00:39:12,806 --> 00:39:14,774
so you can embrace the good.

734
00:39:17,778 --> 00:39:19,712
Maybe you should
take your own advice.

735
00:39:19,747 --> 00:39:20,847
What do you mean?

736
00:39:20,881 --> 00:39:23,649
You're gonna have to let her
go at some point, right?

737
00:39:23,684 --> 00:39:27,954
I mean, deep down you would
know she'd want you to.

738
00:39:33,994 --> 00:39:38,731
If you do end up staying,

739
00:39:38,766 --> 00:39:40,800
know that you have a friend.

740
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:47,707
Maya was a lucky girl.

741
00:40:40,894 --> 00:40:43,095
Out for an evening stroll?

742
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:46,732
I'm just trying
to clear my head.

743
00:40:46,767 --> 00:40:47,800
Rough night?

744
00:40:47,835 --> 00:40:52,705
Rough two years.

745
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:54,941
I've received over 200
calls in the last few days

746
00:40:54,975 --> 00:40:58,044
all swearing they know
who stole Ali's remains.

747
00:40:58,078 --> 00:41:02,849
Everyone's being accused from
Mrs. Welch to Obama to you.

748
00:41:02,883 --> 00:41:06,786
But it's all just lies.

749
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:12,992
You have no idea how
much I'm looking forward

750
00:41:13,026 --> 00:41:14,961
to going to college next year.

751
00:41:14,995 --> 00:41:17,029
Getting out of this place.

752
00:41:17,064 --> 00:41:19,932
All these dysfunctional people.

753
00:41:19,967 --> 00:41:22,902
Yeah, sounds good, doesn't it?

754
00:41:22,936 --> 00:41:25,071
Well, unfortunately,
it doesn't work that way.

755
00:41:25,105 --> 00:41:26,973
Trust me.

756
00:41:27,007 --> 00:41:28,641
You can leave Rosewood,

757
00:41:28,675 --> 00:41:30,810
but Rosewood will
never leave you.

758
00:41:35,048 --> 00:41:37,783
I've got to, uh...
I gotta do a few things.

759
00:41:37,818 --> 00:41:39,785
Driving up to meet my
parents in the morning.

760
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:44,657
Tell them I say hi.

761
00:41:44,691 --> 00:41:47,894
Spencer, I'm withdrawing
the reward.

762
00:41:47,928 --> 00:41:49,996
You were right.

763
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,130
It's too much for me.

764
00:41:53,066 --> 00:41:56,135
Truth always comes out, Jason.

765
00:41:56,169 --> 00:41:58,971
One way or another.

766
00:42:31,805 --> 00:42:34,674
Yeah, meet me in the
parking lot in 15 minutes.

767
00:42:52,759 --> 00:42:54,961
Is there a problem, detective?

768
00:42:54,995 --> 00:42:57,730
How far away is your
parents' lake house?

769
00:42:57,764 --> 00:42:59,031
Why?

770
00:42:59,066 --> 00:43:01,000
Just curious.

771
00:43:10,877 --> 00:43:12,979
